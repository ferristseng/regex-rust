Basing the lib off of this [resource](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/), which covers how to generate, and how to traverse an NFA as well as some other good examples.

Other resources I found useful: 

  * [Creating an NFA from a Regular Expression](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11819185/steps-to-creating-an-nfa-from-a-regular-expression)
  * [Regular Expression to NFA Generator](http://hackingoff.com/compilers/regular-expression-to-nfa-dfa)
  * [re2 Code (C implemntation of regular expressions by the guy who wrote the above paper)](http://code.google.com/p/re2/source/browse/re2/parse.cc)
